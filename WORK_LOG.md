| September 9  |  2:30-3:00  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Kept brainstorming, all of my brainstorming this time was in comments on the main programming file. I think I'm drawing closer to the most effective solution but I still need to do more work. |
| September 9  |  5:05-5:20  |                                                                    I spent this time starting to code, but I encountered a problem. The way I had planned to solve the problem would necessitate fully building the graph out through storing the different connections each city has in a 2D array. This would allow for constant time lookups, but what as I've thought about it more, I have realized that may be use a prohibitive amount of storage. As some of the tester files seem to get nearly to the 10s of thousands of cities, I may have to find another solution that is less storage heavy. |
| September 11 | 10:55-11:25 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I think I figured out the right technique now. WHile earlier, I was worried about the placement of hospitals within the subgroups, I realized that it doesn't matter. The problem is defining the sub groups, and since all cities will have to either be connected to a hospital or have one, and a connection costs less, one hospital per sub group will be enough. |

Really inneficient though. Tomorrow, I will work to find a faster solution. What's taking so long right now probably has something to do with the nested while loops :). |
| September 12 |  8:40-8:55  | I spent this time trying to figure out how I can make my code more efficient. I think my underlying idea of using breadth first search to define the subgroups is correct, but there's something about the implementation that is making it take too long. I think that my method of creating an array of arraylists with every nodes connections speeds it up through constant time lookups, but it is possible that the overhead makes it not worth it. Also, the nested nested while loops probably aren't the best, but it still only visits every node once, so I am not quite sure what the issue is. |
| September 15 |  1:15-1:45  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I spent this time coding the union-find algorithm. I didn't quite finish because I'm running into an issue with the algorithm overwriting unions (my brain isn't braining right now, I know it's a very simple issue that I just can't see), but I am close. |
| september 15 |  5:30-5:45  |                                                                                                                                                                                                     Brain is still not braining. I got the code to work for the first test case, but it doesn't finish any of the other ones. I think the error is that I wrote my cases incorrectly, even if the left doesn't have a root, you have to set the ROOT of the right to be the left, whereas in my code, I just immediately assign the value instead of the root. I will handle this issue in my next session. |
| September 16 | 5:00 - 5:24 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Finally got it working. The problem was that I was trying to automatically set the root of the right side to the left side when the left side is its own root (I was setting the root of the right side, not the root of the root of the right side). In my next session, I will incorporate the techniques to make it more efficient. |
| September 16 |  5:30-6:00  |                                                   I spent this time working on implementing path compression and the other method (I forgot what it's called but I remember how it works) for making union find more efficient. Path compression was pretty easy and I knocked it out in a few minutes, but I'm encountering some problems with the other one. My code runs correctly (I think) for the correct small case (I looked at the array of roots that is printed and it seems to be correct. It also gives the correct answer), but none of the other test cases work. I will debug next session. |
