I think I'm drawing closer to the most effective solution but I still need to do more work. |
| September 9  |  5:05-5:20  | I spent this time starting to code, but I encountered a problem. The way I had planned to solve the problem would necessitate fully building the graph out through storing the different connections each city has in a 2D array. This would allow for constant time lookups, but what as I've thought about it more, I have realized that may be use a prohibitive amount of storage. As some of the tester files seem to get nearly to the 10s of thousands of cities, I may have to find another solution that is less storage heavy. |

WHile earlier, I was worried about the placement of hospitals within the subgroups, I realized that it doesn't matter. The problem is defining the sub groups, and since all cities will have to either be connected to a hospital or have one, and a connection costs less, one hospital per sub group will be enough. |
